## 🔍 Sample ICU/Discharge Boxes

**Example: Malaria (Condition 121)**

**⚠️ ESCALATE TO ICU IF:**
- ALL severe malaria requires ICU admission
- Cerebral malaria (altered mental status, seizures, coma)
- Severe anemia (Hgb <7 g/dL)
- Acute respiratory distress or pulmonary edema
- Renal failure (Cr >3 mg/dL) or requiring dialysis
- Hypoglycemia (<40 mg/dL) refractory or recurrent
- Shock or metabolic acidosis (lactate >5 mmol/L)
- Hyperparasitemia (>5% or >2% with organ dysfunction)
- DIC or significant bleeding

**✓ DISCHARGE CRITERIA:**
- Hemodynamically stable, afebrile >48 hours
- Parasitemia cleared or significantly reduced (<1%)
- No signs of severe malaria (normal mental status, stable labs)
- Tolerating oral antimalarial medication
- Completed appropriate course of IV artesunate (if severe) and transitioned to oral therapy
- Hemoglobin stable (typically >7 g/dL)
- Renal function stable or improving
- Outpatient infectious disease follow-up arranged
- Blood smear follow-up arranged (day 7, 14, 28 to confirm cure)
- Patient educated on medication completion, return precautions
